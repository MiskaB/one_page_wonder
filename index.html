            <h2>1. Coffee Shop</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A small coffee shop owner needs a way for people to find the place, check opening hours, and see what is on offer. Drivers can click and navigate there easily, and the shop is searchable in Google Maps and Apple Maps. No budget, no patience for agencies or technology. Fill out a one-minute form, provide information, and the site shows up on Google, guides to the correct location, displays opening hours, links to Instagram, and allows people to leave those 5-star ratings with nice QR code from the counter. Simple.</p>
                <div class="highlight blue-highlight">Local. Searchable. One page. Built in under 48 hours. Up and running rapidly. Low or no budget at all. QR Code for feedback </div>

                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Change in the Karaoke hours for Thursday-to-Saturday in an old corner pub. No budget for branding or an app or technology, but the need for people to know when to show up and what they’d be singing and with who. The “One-Page Wonder” can be live in less than 2 days — with directions, a songbook list, a Google Map button, access to book songs online, updated opening hours, and 5-star ratings with the easy feedback. That’s it and it works.</p>
                <div class="highlight blue-highlight">Get found. No apps. Just people singing and enjoying. Simple.</div>

                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A family-run bakery sells traditional breads and pastries at local markets and seasonal events. They don’t use social media and didn’t need online ordering. What they did need was to be findable, recommendable and also memorable. Their website is one clean page with a photo, pickup schedule, a map link, and a phone number and email. Now even tourists can find them — and keep coming back. There is also something call TikTok which recently started trending in their location as a result. </p>

No distractions. Just clean visuals and a call-to-action that works on mobile.</p>
