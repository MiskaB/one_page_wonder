                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A small coffee shop owner needs a way for people to find the place, check opening hours, and see what is on offer. Drivers can click and navigate there easily, and the shop is searchable in Google Maps and Apple Maps. No budget, no patience for agencies or technology. Fill out a one-minute form, provide information, and the site shows up on Google, guides to the correct location, displays opening hours, links to Instagram, and allows people to leave those 5-star ratings with nice QR code from the counter. Simple.</p>

The “One-Page Wonder” can be live in less than 2 days — with directions, a songbook list, a Google Map button, access to book songs online, updated opening hours, and 5-star ratings with the easy feedback.

There is also something call TikTok which recently started trending in their location as a result. </p>
