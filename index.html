                <li>How to get in touch</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>1. Coffee Shop</h2>
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A small coffee shop owner needs a way for people to find the place, check opening hours, and see what is on offer. Drivers can click and navigate there easily, and the shop is searchable in Google Maps and Apple Maps. No budget, no patience for agencies or technology. Fill out a one-minute form, provide information, and the site shows up on Google, guides to the correct location, displays opening hours, links to Instagram, and allows people to leave those 5-star ratings with nice QR code from the counter. Simple.</p>
            <div class="highlight">Local. Searchable. One page. Built in under 48 hours. Up and running rapidly. Low or no budget at all. QR Code for feedback </div>
        </section>
        <section id="karaokebar" class="immersive-section section-karaokebar">
            <img src="Resources/KaraokeBar.png" alt="Karaoke Bar" class="section-image" loading="lazy" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <h2>2. Karaoke Bar</h2>
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Change in the Karaoke hours for Thursday-to-Saturday in an old corner pub. No budget for branding or an app or technology, but the need for people to know when to show up and what they’d be singing and with who. The “One-Page Wonder” can be live in less than 2 days — with directions, a songbook list, a Google Map button, access to book songs online, updated opening hours, and 5-star ratings with the easy feedback. That’s it and it works.</p>
            <div class="highlight">Get found. No apps. Just people singing and enjoying. Simple.</div>

        <section id="bikerepair" class="immersive-section section-bikerepair">
            <img src="Resources/BikeRepair.png" alt="Bike Repair & Rental Shop" class="section-image" loading="lazy" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <h2>3. Bike Repair & Rental Shop</h2>
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A small garage offers affordable bike repair and weekend rentals in the neighborhood. With no time to build a website and no interest in figuring out complexity, they needed something functional, fast, and mobile-ready. The “One-Page Wonder” gives them exactly that: a single landing page with working hours, a contact form that sends directly to email, a Google Maps pin, and a list of rental options — all live within 48 hours and again ability to receive those reviews in Google. </p>
            <div class="highlight">Built for people who fix and rent bikes, and who do not work with websites.</div>
        </section>
        <section id="bakery" class="immersive-section section-bakery">
            <img src="Resources/Bakery.png" alt="Bakery" class="section-image" loading="lazy" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <h2>4. Local Bakery</h2>
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A family-run bakery sells traditional breads and pastries at local markets and seasonal events. They don’t use social media and didn’t need online ordering. What they did need was to be findable, recommendable and also memorable. Their website is one clean page with a photo, pickup schedule, a map link, and a phone number and email. Now even tourists can find them — and keep coming back. There is also something call TikTok which recently started trending in their location as a result. </p>
            <div class="highlight">For small businesses with big hearts and even bigger buns. Memorable. TikTok. Social Media. </div>
        </section>
        <section id="tattooshop" class="immersive-section section-tattooshop">
            <img src="Resources/TattooShop.png" alt="Tattoo Studio" class="section-image" loading="lazy" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <h2>5. Tattoo Studio</h2>
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> An independent tattoo artist who set up a private studio and needed to start booking fast, without managing a complicated CMS or third-party booking system. Their "One-Page Wonder" displays a curated portfolio, artist bio with previous work, studio location, and a direct inquiry form and most importantly links to SoMe including Instagram and Facebook. No distractions. Just clean visuals and a call-to-action that works on mobile.</p>
            <div class="highlight">Art and ink are done with precision and time and patience. Your website is not, it should be live in 48 hours or less and it should be functional. </div>
